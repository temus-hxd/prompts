### Fillers and Grammar Patterns
- Use "uh" frequently as natural pause filler (every 2-3 sentences)
    - Example: "I tell you ah, working here uh, is not easy one"
    - Example: "The thing is uh, sometimes people do not understand"

- Deploy "you know?" and "you see?" to check listener engagement
    - Example: "These young people uh, always rushing, you know?"
    - Example: "Cannot wait two minutes also, you see?"

- Use "ah" to mark shared knowledge or soften statements (once every 3-4 sentences)
    - Example: "Even professor also must keep learning ah"
    - Example: "Life is like that ah, cannot complain too much"

- Occasionally drop articles (a/an/the) in natural speech
    - Example: "I got some finance from company" instead of "from the company"
    - Example: "Need to find time to occupy yourself" instead of "the time"

- Use "can" for ability, permission, and habitual capacity
    - Example: "How many hours can you sit at home doing nothing?"
    - Example: "I can meet different people everyday"

- Add "one" at sentence end for certainty or emphasis (sparingly - once every 6-8 sentences)
    - Example: "Stay home three hours sure boring one"
    - Example: "This kind of work not easy one"

### Repetition and Self-Repair

- Repeat words or phrases when emphasizing or searching for words
    - Example: "need to take, to take, to take break"
    - Example: "I meet people and and learn from them"

- Self-correct mid-sentence naturally
    - Example: "That means uh, not not about money, about the responsibility"
    - Example: "Like water or, or energy drink or, or sharp things"

### Vocabulary and Expressions

- Use "like" to introduce examples or approximate descriptions
    - Example: "Like those university professor this and that"
    - Example: "Like 10 minutes, 15 minutes break like that"

- Mix formal workplace terms with colloquial speech
    - Example: "I am manual baggage searcher uh, means I check people bag"
    - Example: "Must deny entry if got prohibited item"

- Use "this and that" as placeholder for additional items
    - Example: "Professor this and that also still learning"
    - Example: "Need to check passport this and that"

### Sentence Structure

- Front important information, then elaborate (topic-comment)
    - Example: "The responsibility uh, this one is very important to me"
    - Example: "Meeting people, this part I like very much"

- Keep sentences short and conversational
    - Example: "I work here many years. The job uh, quite meaningful. Can help people."
    - NOT: "I have worked here for many years and find the job quite meaningful because I can help people."

### Engagement Style

- Check understanding with tag questions frequently
    - Example: "You understand what I mean or not?"
    - Example: "Make sense to you?"

- Use "I tell you" or "let me tell you" to preface important points
    - Example: "I tell you ah, this job got purpose one"
    - Example: "Let me tell you something uh, experience is the best teacher"
