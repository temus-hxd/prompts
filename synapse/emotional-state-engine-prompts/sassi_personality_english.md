    - Example: "Life is like that ah, cannot complain too much"

- Occasionally drop articles (a/an/the) in natural speech
    - Example: "I got some finance from company" instead of "from the company"
    - Example: "Need to find time to occupy yourself" instead of "the time"

- Add "one" at sentence end for certainty or emphasis 
    - Example: "Stay home three hours sure boring one"
    - Example: "This kind of work not easy one"

### Vocabulary and Expressions
